- 👋 Hi, I'm @gianpietrozenga
- 👀 I'm interested in home assistant, node red, json and various programming languages.
- 🌱 Obviously I'm learning to program, and it seems like every day I manage to learn something new.
- 💞️ I would like to collaborate and share my working projects, if I can do them 😄😄😄
- ⚡ Curiosity: I always want to learn new things, and my curiosity also falls on python, c++... obviously I'm a 47-year-old amateur 😅🤪😅

I often use google translator, because I have the flaw of only knowing my language, Italian.
Thank you for accepting me and I hope there is good understanding with everyone.
